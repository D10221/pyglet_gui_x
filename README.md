# pyglet_gui_x
pyglet + pyglet_gui + x?

exploring python3, type hints, found pyglet [pyglet_gui][1] proposing a more delarative, modular approach
to draw components/controls and separating theming from structure .   
 it ignited my imagination, what if you could use a simple one way data-binding?
   ui observing changes, triggering back signals-like to models/view-models ?
   I played with a naive, gist like, mvvmish ... sort of implementation
   then simplistic xml parsing could allow, potentially type hinting with just the right schema?
   and eventually expand the declarative mechanics to ui composition ?
